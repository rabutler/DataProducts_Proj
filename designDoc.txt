Background:
Understand how risks change due to (a) different assumptions, e.g.,
hydrology, or (b) observed conditions change.

Use April and October DNF and VIC as 4 scenarios of examples

Want to include as example:
- sample data with 'Bronco Reservoir' and 'Deep Snow Lake'
- two tabs:
	-- tab1 = decile plots of monthly data
	-- tab2 = risk calculations

Tab 1
- select which months with radio button
- select Scenarios with check boxes
- select which percentiles you want  
	-- check boxes for max through all deciles to min
- select the slot to plot
	-- PE
	-- Storage
- update y axis label and title based on the selected slot

Tab 2
- select scenarios as check boxes 
	-- Done, but add in the dynamic adding scenarios.
- select Powell or Mead as radio button DONE
- select month, annual max, or annual min DONE 
- enter the elevation DONE 
- plot % of traces/year as line plot DONE
- display total % of traces in time period in table or on plot?

To fill selectInput with variable names, use the following as an example:

Think that we can modify the searchResult in the example to use 
levels(zz$Variable).
Try this out on the Scenario selection of tab2.
