Background:
Understand how risks change due to (a) different assumptions, e.g.,
hydrology, or (b) observed conditions change.

Use April and October DNF and VIC as 4 scenarios of examples

Want to include as example:
- sample data with 'Bronco Reservoir' and 'Deep Snow Lake'
- two tabs:
	-- tab1 = decile plots of monthly data
	-- tab2 = risk calculations
	-- tab3 = individual trace plots (OPTIONAL)
Tab 1
- select which months with radio button
- select Scenarios with check boxes
- select which percentiles you want  
	-- check boxes for max through all deciles to min
- select the slot to plot
	-- PE
	-- Storage
- update y axis label and title based on the selected slot

Tab 2
- select scenarios as check boxes	
	-- show combined scenario risk?
- select Powell or Mead as radio button
- select month, annual max, or annual min
- enter the elevation
- plot % of traces/year as line plot
- display total % of traces in time period in table or on plot?
